# Games:

## Billard using Siri 
There is a clock around the white ball with the white ball in the middle. 
People can choose the shooting direction by saying the hour number (1-12) and the force (how hard to hit) by 
saying Strong, Normal or Weak (3 level for now).
For example: "3Strong" mean shoot the ball STRONGLY in the direction 3 O'CLOCK.
